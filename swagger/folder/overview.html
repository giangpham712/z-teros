<p>In our demonstrator, the folder structures are stored inside our Postgres DB.  Should this data need to be held within the zTeros platform, the database and API could treat the folder structure as an additional record and inject it into the zTeros API also.  Clearly, with different permission levels this could become quite complex to both provide access to and maintain as a robust dataset, so diligent planning is required should you wish to maintain such a system.</p>
